# Github querier

1. Queries the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/) for various bits of telemetry
1. Dispatches workload to [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) to divide the work up
1. Remaps the relevant data to a series of non vendor specific data model
1. Writes to [dynamodb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for later analysis

Query is done by _something else_ TBC, this just carries out ETL
